### 1 -> What are some difference between interface and types in TypeScripts

**Syntax**
Interface uses `interface` keyword :

```ts
interface MyInterface {
    name: string;
    email: string;
    age: number;
}
```

Type uses the `type` keyword and an equal sign after that:

```ts
type MyType = {
    name: string;
    email: string;
    age: number;
}
```
